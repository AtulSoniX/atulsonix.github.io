📚 I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, with a specialisation in Power Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India. 

🧑🏻‍💻 My Ph.D. thesis focused on developing **adaptive protection coordination (protection & control) schemes in AC microgrids** to determine optimal relays' settings using optimization techniques for non-linear mathematical models and hardware validation. 

🧑🏻‍💻 Currently, I'm working as an Engineer, Transmission Planning and Grid Integration Studies at EEGrid Analytics Pvt. Ltd., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of EEPLUS Inc. In my current role at EEPLUS Inc., I have gained valuable experience in steady-state, short-circuit, and stability studies in transmission systems due to integration of large loads, conventional generating units, and inverter-interfaced resources.
